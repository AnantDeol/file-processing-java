# Book Management System

This project is a Java-based Book Management System that allows users to process input files containing book records, validate the data, and categorize them into different genres. The system consists of three main parts: 

1. **Part 1**: Parsing input files, handling syntax errors, and categorizing books into genre-specific files.  
2. **Part 2**: Validating book records, serializing valid books, and handling semantic errors.  
3. **Part 3**: Deserializing book records, providing a user interface for navigation, and viewing book details.  

## Features

- **File Handling**: Parse input files, handle syntax errors, and categorize books into appropriate genre files.  
- **Data Validation**: Validate book records for correctness, including price, ISBN, and publication year.  
- **Serialization**: Serialize validated books into binary files for storage and future retrieval.  
- **User Interface**: Provide a command-line interface for navigating through categorized book files and viewing book details.  
- **Exception Handling**: Handle various types of exceptions gracefully, providing meaningful error messages.
