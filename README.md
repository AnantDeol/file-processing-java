# Book Management System
This project is a Java-based Book Management System that allows users to process input files containing book records, validate the data, and categorize them into different genres. The system consists of three main parts:

**Part 1:** Parsing input files, handling syntax errors, and categorizing books into genre-specific files.
**Part 2:** Validating book records, serializing valid books, and handling semantic errors.
**Part 3**: Deserializing book records, providing a user interface for navigation, and viewing book details.

## Features

**File Handling:** Parse input files, handle syntax errors, and categorize books into appropriate genre files.
**Data Validation:** Validate book records for correctness, including price, ISBN, and publication year.
**Serialization:** Serialize validated books into binary files for storage and future retrieval.
**User Interface:** Provide a command-line interface for navigating through categorized book files and viewing book details.
**Exception Handling**: Handle various types of exceptions gracefully, providing meaningful error messages.
